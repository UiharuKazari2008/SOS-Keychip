# RP-KeychipEmulator
pho-ALLS Keychip emulator designed to volume decryption keys to scripts

This is not in any way compatible with a offical ALLS/Nu keychip system and is designed to work with a sudo-ALLS setup where sgpreboot does not exist and where the game would normally be decrypted in this case its encrypted and uese this as a hardware verification step just cause.

This is also not designed to be high security and is just ment for fun, Current design uses the Pimoroni Tiny2040 but the Waveshare GEEK-2040 is also desired as it has a LCD that can be used

Fuck off this does not violate any copyright, try me
