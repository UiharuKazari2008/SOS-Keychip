# RP-KeychipEmulator
pho-ALLS Keychip emulator designed to volume decryption keys to scripts

This is not in any way compatible with a offial ALLS/Nu keychip system and is designed to work with a sudo-ALLS setup where sgpreboot does not exist and where the game would normally be decrypted in this case its encrypted and uese this as a hardware verification step just cause.

Fuck off this does not violate any copyright, try me
